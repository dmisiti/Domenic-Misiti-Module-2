Module 2 Challenge -- VBA Stock Analysis

In this challenge, VBA was utilized in an Excel document containing stock market data, with the purpose of analyzing the quarterly change and quarterly stock volume for a given set of tickers.

The VBA script used for analysis in this Excel document can be found in the VBA interface under the name "Module 1" (Sub StockAnalysis). (It is also copied into a separate .bas file.)

Analysis was done on four different worksheets of data, representing four different quarters (Q1-Q4). A screenshot is attached for the analysis results of each quarter.
